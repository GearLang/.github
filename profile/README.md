	<i>GearLang is not ready yet...</i>

	GearLang is a whole ecosystem turing around of its eponymous language and of Gear, a multi-langage and configurable compiler.
	Unlike most transpilers, GearLang optimizes its code by interpreting the provided logic. That means that large parts of code are optimized and reduced for minimal runtime interpretation.

	Gear can be used both as a standard user to generate your own code, or as a meta programmer and use GearLang in order to create your own pre-compiler.

	Despite of being able to support any language, GearLang focuses on pre-compiling interpreted langages. Indeed most of compilers to assembly are already running most of the optimizations offered by Gear.
	On the other hand, Gear can considerably reduce the running time of the slowest interpreted languages.
